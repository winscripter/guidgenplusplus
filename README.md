# guidgenplusplus
A tiny WPF application that can generate up to 10 various GUIDs. Inspired by GuidGen.exe Visual Studio utility.

# What can it do?
While it is definitely not the most sophisticated programs in the world (in fact, it took me like 2 hours to code up), it can at least
perform some tasks that guidgen.exe in Visual Studio can't. For instance, better UI, light/dark theme support, and more GUID types.

# Why?
Just because it has a few more GUID types that I definitely needed to be auto-generated.

I believe this first release will also be the last one. I think this program has everything a normal GUID generator needs.
